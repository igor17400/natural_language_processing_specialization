# Natural Language Processing Specialization - Coursera

Welcome to my repository for the Coursera Natural Language Processing Specialization. This comprehensive guide documents my journey, key learnings, and projects as I navigate through the four-course specialization. It is designed for anyone interested in delving into the world of NLP and exploring its applications through a structured and practical approach.

## Specialization Overview

The Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered on Coursera, is divided into four pivotal courses, each focusing on a distinct set of techniques and applications within NLP:

1. **Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces**: Focuses on sentiment analysis, analogies completion, and word translation using logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors.
2. **Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models**: Delves into implementing autocorrect, autocomplete, and part-of-speech tagging for words using dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings.
3. **Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models**: Explores the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in Trax for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text generation, and named entity recognition.
4. **Natural Language Processing with Attention Models**: Covers advanced topics like machine translation, text summarization, chatbot creation, and question answering using encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention mechanisms.

## Learnings from the course

This specialization equips learners with the ability to:

- Implement sentiment analysis and complete analogies using logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors.
- Utilize dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings for autocorrect, autocomplete, and identifying part-of-speech tags.
- Apply RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks for sentiment analysis, text generation, and named entity recognition.
- Employ encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention mechanisms for machine translating sentences, summarizing texts, building chatbots, and developing question-answering systems.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to reflect the structure of the specialization, with directories dedicated to each course and their respective projects:

- `Course 1/`: Contains notes, assignments, and projects related to "NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces".
- `Course 2/`: Includes resources and implementations for "NLP with Probabilistic Models".
- `Course 3/`: Hosts content for "NLP with Sequence Models", including RNNs and LSTMs projects.
- `Course 4/`: Features work on "NLP with Attention Models", showcasing encoder-decoder and self-attention applications.

## Projects

Here, you will find detailed documentation and source code for each project undertaken during the specialization. These projects serve as practical applications of the concepts learned and demonstrate my proficiency in solving real-world NLP challenges.

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thank you to the instructors and contributors of the Coursera Natural Language Processing Specialization for designing such a detailed and hands-on learning experience. This journey has significantly advanced my understanding and skills in NLP, and I'm excited to apply these in future projects.
